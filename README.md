### Introduction


Temperature Converter is a web program written in JavaScript that converts temperatures between units per user selection. It also allows you to check your work by providing your own (or perhaps your students') answer, which the program will automatically grade.





### Requirements



The only thing you need to use Temperature Conversion Calculator is a web browser capable of opening a local HTML file.




### Set up


In order to set up Temperature Conversion Calculator, you can simply download the .html file from the repository and then open it in the browser of your choice (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

Alternatively, the .html file could be hosted on a website for users to access whether they have the .html file on their device or not.
