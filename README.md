### Introduction


Temperature Converter is a web program written in JavaScript that converts temperatures between units per user selection. It also allows you to check your work by providing your own (or perhaps your students') answer, which the program will automatically grade.





### Requirements



The only thing you need to use Temperature Conversion Calculator is a web browser capable of opening a local HTML file.




### Set up


In order to set up Temperature Conversion Calculator, you can simply download the .html file from the repository and then open it in the browser of your choice (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

Alternatively, the .html file could be hosted on a website for users to access whether they have the .html file on their device or not.



### Instructions


When the webpage has been loaded, the user will be given the option to enter a temperature and guess (or student answer), and select units to convert from and to with dropdown menus.

If the guess is correct, the program will tell the user.

If it isn't, the program will tell the user that, too.

If an invalid temperature (a temperature that isn't a number) is given, the program will account for that:

The same goes for an invalid guess:
